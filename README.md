# VRZombieMaze
A simple and small VR Zombie Maze that I made with Unity for my VR class at Ewha Womans' University during Fall 2018.
The lighting, textures, materials, scripts (except for the Oculus/VIVE/Emulated HMD scripts), particles, and level-design were handcrafted by myself.

The zipped builds are too large to upload to github a link to the builds in my Google Drive is included below:

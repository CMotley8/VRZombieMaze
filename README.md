# VRZombieMaze
A simple and small VR Zombie Maze that I made with Unity for my VR class at Ewha Womans' University during Fall 2018.
The lighting, textures, materials, scripts (except for the Oculus/VIVE/Emulated HMD scripts), particles, and level-design were handcrafted by myself.

Link to my UNCC Mahara page with screenshots and descriptions of the project:

The files are too large to upload to github. 

A link to the files in my Google Drive is included below (the files are also available on the mahara page linked above):

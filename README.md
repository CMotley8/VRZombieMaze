# VRZombieMaze
A simple and small VR Zombie Maze that I made with Unity for my VR class at Ewha Womans' University during Fall 2018.
The lighting, textures, materials, scripts (except for the Oculus/VIVE/Emulated HMD scripts), particles, and level-design were handcrafted by myself.

The files are too large to upload to github(the files are also available on the mahara page linked above)â€” a link to the files in my Google Drive is included below:
